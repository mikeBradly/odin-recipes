# odin-recipes
In this project, I'll be building a basic recipe website with a primary focus on the HTML groundwork, but I'll keep an exploratory attitude for CSS to make the page look nice.

## Project Overview

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Create an `index.html` file with an "Odin Recipes" heading.
  
### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Create a `recipes` directory.
- Inside the `recipes` directory, create HTML files for different recipes.
- Add an "Odin Recipes" link in `index.html` to each recipe page.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- Populate each recipe page with:
  - An image of the finished dish.
  - A description of the recipe.
  - An ingredients list.
  - A step-by-step guide.
  
### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Add two more recipes with similar page structures as the previous ones.
- Update the links in `index.html` accordingly.
